# starter-react-mobx-css-modules
My starter kit for projects based on React, MobX and CSS Modules.

This kit consists of the latest versions of:
* React
* Webpack
* MobX
* SCSS
* CSS Modules
* TypeScript

#### Build Instructions

`npm install`

`npm build`

The output goes to `/build/bundle.js` & `/build/index.html`

#### Development Server

`npm dev-server`

I’m about to add TypeScript support as well.
